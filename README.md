# DataPlay_LogParser
**Log parser using Python**

The goal is to parse raw log data into structured data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and draw insights about user behaviour,roles, and system activity over time.

It includes:

-Log parsing using re and datetime

-EDA using Counter, set, and basic loops

-Hourly activity analysis

-Console-based output

-Deploy the parser and analysis tool using Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.
